<b>On a standard wall outlet (120VAC)...</b><br>
1 kwh gets an e-scooter 20 miles (from 6 hours of charging)<br>
1 kwh gets a Telsa about 3 miles (from 1 hour of charging)<br><br>

Telsa charging requires 750 watts of overhead to run the cooling circuits and pumps, plus initial losses.<br>
120VAC is only about 50% efficient, requiring 2kWhr to put 1kWhr into the batteries.<br>
120VAC @ 12A = 1440 watts (Leaves about 690 watts going into the batteries.)<br>
240VAC @ 32A = 7680 watts (Leaves 6930 watts going into the batteries. 90% efficient.<br><br>
